                        At its core, concentrated stock risk is a form of <strong class="text-white">unsystematic risk</strong>. While systematic risk affects the entire market (e.g., interest rate changes, geopolitical events), unsystematic risk is specific to a single company or industry. It's the risk that your company's stock could plummet due to factors that don't impact the broader market, such as a failed product launch, regulatory trouble, or an accounting scandal.

                        When a large portion of your net worth is tied to one stock, your financial well-being is tethered to the fortunes of that single entity. The same forces that drove the stock's incredible growth can also lead to a swift and devastating decline, erasing years of accumulated wealth. Diversification is the time-tested antidote to this specific risk.

                        To grasp the threat of a concentrated position, it's helpful to separate investment risk into two distinct categories.

                    While stories of skyrocketing single stocks like Amazon or Apple dominate headlines, they are the rare exception, not the rule. The long-term performance of the average individual stock is often surprisingly poor. Holding a concentrated position is a bet that your company will not only succeed but become one of these outliers.
