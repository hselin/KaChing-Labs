                        At its core, concentrated stock risk is a form of <strong class="text-white">unsystematic risk</strong>. While systematic risk affects the entire market (e.g., interest rate changes, geopolitical events), unsystematic risk is specific to a single company or industry. It's the risk that your company's stock could plummet due to factors that don't impact the broader market, such as a failed product launch, regulatory trouble, or an accounting scandal.

                        When a large portion of your net worth is tied to one stock, your financial well-being is tethered to the fortunes of that single entity. The same forces that drove the stock's incredible growth can also lead to a swift and devastating decline, erasing years of accumulated wealth. Diversification is the time-tested antidote to this specific risk.

                        To grasp the threat of a concentrated position, it's helpful to separate investment risk into two distinct categories.
