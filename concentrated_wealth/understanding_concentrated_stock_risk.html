                        For many successful entrepreneurs, early employees, and long-term investors, wealth is intrinsically linked to the success of a single company. It is often described as a "good problem to have," a situation born not from error, but from extraordinary success. However, this concentration of wealth also presents significant, often unforeseen, risks.

                    Bogle's advice to 'buy the haystack' stems from a stark reality in how individual stocks perform over the long term. While the stories of major successes are well-known, they are the rare exception, not the rule.
